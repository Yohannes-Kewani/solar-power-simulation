Solar Power Simulation

Overview

This project provides a simple Solar Power Simulation script in Python. It estimates the daily energy output of a solar panel based on key parameters like solar irradiance, panel area, efficiency, and sunlight hours. The tool is useful for renewable energy analysis and solar panel efficiency studies.

Features

Calculates daily energy output (kWh) of a solar panel.

Uses solar irradiance, panel area, efficiency, and sunlight hours as input.

Simple and lightweight Python script for quick energy estimation.

Installation

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Then, clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solar-power-simulation.git
cd solar-power-simulation

Usage

Run the script using Python:

python solar_simulation.py

Example Calculation

By default, the script uses:

Solar Irradiance: 1000 W/m²

Panel Area: 1.6 m²

Efficiency: 20%

Sunlight Hours: 5 hours

This outputs:

Estimated daily energy output: X.XX kWh

Modify the input values in solar_simulation.py to simulate different scenarios.

Contributing

Feel free to contribute by improving calculations, adding real-time solar data integration, or optimizing the code.
